Project done as a part of Machine Learning (CSE343) at IIIT Delhi.

Code files are uploaded, ML_1.ipynb contains data pre processing and EDA, ML_2.ipynb contains final models and predictions algorithms.
Reports contain interim and final report of the project.
Plots contains all EDA, Dataset and Predictions of our model.

Models are not saved as the training time is very less and the ipynb files can be used to get predictions.
